# PERDIX-6HB
Welcome to the PERDIX project! PERDIX is an open-source Fortran library, which allows scientists to build and solve the sequence design of complex DNA nanostructures.

**PERDIX:**
* **P**urine (Adenine & Guanine) / Pyrimidine (Cytosine & Thymine)
* **E**ngineered
* **R**outing
* **D**esign
* **I**nverse
* **X** = unknown variable as staple sequences

**Software variants:**
* **[PERDIX-6P](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-6P)**: 6HB based 3D DNA nanoparticle
* **[PERDIX-2L](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-2L)**: DX-based 2D DNA lattice structure

# Setup
```git clone https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-6P.git```

# Features
* Fully automatic procedure for the sequence design of complex DNA nanostructures
* User-friendly TUI (Text-based User Interface)
* 3D visualization powered by [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)
* Free and open source (GNU General Public License, version 2.0)
* Two vertex design; flat and beveled vertex
* Cross-platform application
