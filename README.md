## Setup</br>
```git clone https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-6P.git```

**Requirements:**</br>
[Intel Fortran compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers) (tested version - Interl Parallel Studio XE 2016, 2017 and 2018)</br>

- Compiling the PERDIX sources require [Intel Fortran](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers). Intel Fortran is available under a free, non-commercial license for qualified students on Linux, OS X and WIndows, see the [details](https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/).</br>
- The atomic model ([PDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format))) can be generated by cndo file using [MATLAB scripts](https://cando-dna-origami.org/atomic-model-generator/) written by Dr. Keyao Pan.</br></br>
