Running PERDIX on command line

ex) PERDIX-6P 1 2 1 2           <- 6HB Tetrahedron 63bp - mitered vertex
ex) PERDIX-6P ex_tet.ply 1 1 3  <- User-defined geometry named as ex_tet.ply with 84-bp - flat vertex

- First input: Target geometry - Pre-defined geometries (from 0 to 45) or type geometry file name
- Second input: Flat (1) and mitered (2)
- Third input: Inner (1) or middle (2) reference
- Third input: Minimum edge length
